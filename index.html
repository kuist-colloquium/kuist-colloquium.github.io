        <p class="card-text">The world underlying images and videos is 3-dimensional and dynamic, with people interacting with each other, objects, and the underlying scene. Even in videos of a static scene, there is always the camera moving about in the 4D world. However, disentangling this 4D world from a video is a challenging inverse problem due to fundamental ambiguities of depth and scale. Yet, accurately recovering this information is essential for building systems that can reason about and interact with the underlying scene, and has immediate applications in visual effects and creation of immersive digital worlds. In this talk, I will discuss recent updates in 4D human perception, which includes disentangling the camera and the human motion from challenging in-the-wild videos with multiple people. Our approach takes advantage of background pixels as cues for camera motion, which when combined with motion priors and inferred ground planes can resolve scene scale and depth ambiguities up to an "anthropometric" scale. I will also talk about nerf.studio, a modular open-source framework for easily creating photorealistic 3D scenes and accelerating NeRF development. I will introduce two new works that highlight how language can be incorporated for editing and interacting with the recovered 3D scenes. These works leverage large-scale vision and language models, demonstrating the potential for multi-modal exploration and manipulation of 3D scenes</p>

        <p class="card-text">Generative AI has seen a surge in popularity, with Diffusion Models (DMs) being a crucial component of many successful visual content generation techniques. Examples include DALL-E by OpenAI, Imagen by Google, and Stable Diffusion by Stability AI. While DMs are commonly known for their ability to generate content, our research group has discovered that DMs are also highly effective general problem solvers. Specifically, we focus on structured geometry modeling (e.g., CAD models). We have recently made significant strides in vector graphicsfloorplan generation, HD map reconstruction, and spatial arrangement estimation. DM-based approaches consistently achieve the best performance across all tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods tailored to specific tasks.</p>

        <p class="card-text">I will present our recent work on how a general AI algorithm can be used for 3D scene understanding to reduce the need for training data. More exactly, we propose several modifications of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to retrieve objects and room layouts from noisy RGB-D scans.  While MCTS was developed as a game-playing algorithm, we show it can also be used for complex perception problems.  Our adapted MCTS algorithm has few easy-to-tune hyperparameters and can optimise general losses. We use it to optimise the posterior probability of objects and room layout hypotheses given the RGB-D data.  This results in a render-and-compare method that explores the solution space efficiently. I will then show that the same algorithm can be applied to other scene understanding problems.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Terahertz (THz) computational imaging has recently attracted significant attention thanks to its non-invasive, non-destructive, non-ionizing, material-classification, and ultra-fast nature for 3D object exploration and inspection. However, its strong water absorption nature and low noise tolerance lead to undesired blurs and distortions of reconstructed THz images. The performances of existing methods are highly constrained by the diffraction-limited THz signals. In this talk, we will introduce the characteristics of THz imaging and its applications. We will also show how to break the limitations of THz imaging with the aid of complementary information between the THz amplitude and phase images sampled at prominent frequencies (i.e., the water absorption profile of THz signal) for THz image restoration. To this end, we propose a novel physics-guided deep neural network design, namely Subspace-Attention-guided Restoration Network (SARNet), that fuses such multi-spectral features of THz images for effective restoration. Furthermore, we experimentally construct an ultra-fast THz time-domain spectroscopy system covering a broad frequency range from 0.1 THz to 4 THz for building up temporal/spectral/spatial/phase/material THz database of hidden 3D objects.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Photometric stereo is a longstanding computer vision problem focused on recovering a detailed surface normal map of objects in a scene using images captured under varying illumination. Despite the simplicity of the basic problem statement, the underlying problem formulation and image acquisition setups are incredibly complex. To apply a photometric stereo method, the appropriate algorithm must be selected and images carefully captured in a controlled environment, taking into consideration assumptions about surface geometry, material, camera, and lighting. In this talk, I share my journey toward overcoming the fundamental challenges in photometric stereo by introducing the learning-based photometric stereo method, named "universal" photometric stereo, which aims to remove these complicated assumptions and acquisition setups. When performing deep learning on photometric stereo tasks, managing varying numbers of unordered input images under different lighting conditions is a critical challenge. I will firstly discuss my previous attempts to address this issue, including the development of an "observation map" (ECCV 2018, ICIP 2021) and a "light-axis transformer" (BMVC 2021), and how these ideas were extended to universal photometric stereo networks.<br><br>The core of my talk presents my recent universal photometric stereo networks (UniPS, CVPR 2022 and SDM-UniPS, CVPR 2023), which can recover impressively detailed surface normal maps even when images are captured under unknown, spatially-varying lighting conditions in uncontrolled environments. This advancement enables the application of photometric stereo in everyday settings, effectively allowing for Real-World Photometric Stereo.</p>
